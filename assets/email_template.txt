--
h3abionet/TADA is a a Nextflow workflow using dada2 for targeted amplicon data analysis. 
The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from
high-throughput amplicon sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less accurate
OTU clustering approach. The dada2 pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
files, and outputs the sequence variants and their sample-wise abundances after
removing substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic classification is available
via a native implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian classifier, and genus-species
assignment by exact matching. Please reference the authors of dada2 if using this pipeline. For more information on dada2 usage, please visit http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ . For more information on the Nextflow implementation of this pipeline, please visit https://github.com/h3abionet/TADA
